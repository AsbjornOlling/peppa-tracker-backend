# IoT Prototyping Project: Tracker Web Backend

## How to run

First, install the python dependencies with pip:

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Then, assuming you already have make/cmake installed, just run:

```sh
make
```

This will host the python web application on port https://localhost:8000.
You can access it from the browser now.
It *should* watch for changes to the python files, and reload the application whenever necessary.
